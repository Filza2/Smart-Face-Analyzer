# Smart-Face-Analyzer
Smart Face Analyzer is a browser-based face analysis and comparison tool built using face-api.js.
It can detect multiple faces, estimate age, gender, and emotion, and compare similarities between different images — all locally in your browser without uploading or saving any data.

Built for privacy, performance, and accuracy.
Works entirely client-side with real-time analysis and responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
